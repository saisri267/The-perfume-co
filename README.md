The Perfume Co
Project Description

The Perfume Co is a simple e-commerce web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application is designed to display a limited collection of perfume products, allowing users to browse and view product information through a clean and user-friendly interface.

The frontend is built using React.js for rendering product listings and handling user interactions. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, which provides RESTful APIs to fetch perfume data from a MongoDB database. This project focuses on understanding full-stack application flow, frontend–backend communication, and database integration, without implementing payment or checkout functionality.

The project was created for learning and academic purposes, demonstrating core MERN stack concepts.
